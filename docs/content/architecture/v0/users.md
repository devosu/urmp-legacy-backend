# `Users` Route Design

To logically separate singular and batch endpoints while maintaining clarity and adhering to RESTful principles, consider the following naming conventions and structural suggestions:

1. **Singular Endpoint for User Operations**:
   - **Purpose**: Handling operations on individual user profiles, such as retrieving, updating, or deleting a single user.
   - **Endpoint**: `/v0/users/:userId`
     - `GET /v0/users/:userId` - Retrieve a specific user's profile.
     - `PUT /v0/users/:userId` - Update a specific user's profile.
     - `DELETE /v0/users/:userId` - Delete a specific user's profile.

2. **Batch Endpoint for Bulk Operations**:
   - **Purpose**: Handling operations that affect multiple users at once, such as batch updates or batch approvals.
   - **Endpoint**: `/v0/users/batch`
     - `PUT /v0/users/batch` - Update multiple user profiles at once. The request body should contain an array of user objects or user IDs along with the updates to be applied.
     - `POST /v0/users/batch` - (Optional) If there's a need to create multiple users at once, though this is less common in practice.

3. **General Collection Endpoint**:
   - **Purpose**: Handling collection-level operations, such as listing users or creating a new user.
   - **Endpoint**: `/v0/users`
     - `GET /v0/users` - List all users or a subset of users based on query parameters.
     - `POST /v0/users` - Create a new user profile.

**Best Practices to Consider**:

- **Clarity and Predictability**: The endpoint paths should clearly indicate their function to both developers and users of the API.
- **Use of HTTP Methods**: Leverage the semantics of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to indicate the action being performed.
- **Versioning**: Keeping the version in the URL (`/v0/`) allows for future iterations of the API without breaking existing clients.
- **Resource Nesting**: Avoid deeply nested resources. In this case, keeping user operations under `/users` with optional specifiers like `/batch` or `/:userId` keeps the API intuitive.
- **Security and Permissions**: Ensure that batch operations, especially, are properly secured and accessible only to users with the appropriate permissions (e.g., admins).

This structure provides a clear separation between operations on individual resources and bulk operations, making the API easier to understand and use.
