2. Which fields should I **CREATE** at `application` stage? And **why**?
3. Which fields should I **UPDATE** at `admin review and approval` stage? And **why**?

> ## :fist_right::fist_left: `Backend` - `Database` Integration

We use [`Firestore`](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore/) as our serverless NoSQL database. Our Node.js 22 `backend` has **secure** and unrestricted access to the production database through the [`Firebase Admin SDK`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup). See our `src/models/v1/userModel.ts` for details.
